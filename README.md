# CAN Resources

The [Uwindsor P1 page](https://github.com/UWindsor/CarHackingResearch) contains some instructions for the P1 and some research papers. There is also [P1 documentation](https://docs.macchina.cc/p1-docs/getting-started)

The kernel level documentation on SocketCAN and CAN interfaces is [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/can.html). This can be used to communicate via the CAN interface through raw sockets in C.

There is a linux package which provides utilities for working with CAN interfaces and messages, [can-utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils)

There look to be two solid Python libraries which provide access to CAN interfaces
- [python-can](https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can)
- [socketcan](https://gitlab.com/Menschel/socketcan)
